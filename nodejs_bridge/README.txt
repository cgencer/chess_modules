To-do:

DrupalChat intergration: 
* need to add icon beside players name to initiate a game
* (no live users would be shown on DrupalChat, so cant be clicked)
* when clicked, creates a bridge-message with a game-id
* 	-> sends the game id as an invitation to the clicked user-id
*	-> joins the live-game with the game id

message queue:
* AI solver, table to AI, AI to table
* AI player

optional:

* create a timed game, saves these into a database-table
*	-> sends a login to the user by either pm or mail to the specific user
*	-> awaits the users on the specified time (e.g. table wont open <10 mins of its time)
* sms message to the specified user can be intergrated if the users provide their mobiles also
